# CRITICAL ANALYSIS

This anaylsis covers the three areas of the project. As of now, Render and Animation are complete, and thus written about here, and in futuree coding will be appended.

## Modelling

The main thing here is that I did not know Blenders tools, and coming from Maya, had a lot of difficulty adjusting. In many aspects, having examined the tools more, there is many areas I could gretly improve my flow in future. Perhaps foremost amongst these is that I did not use the mirror tool at all, but having seen it in use, I could see that it would have been greatly useful for the creation of the sword, spear and hammer models. This alone would have made my production much faster, and likely better quality.

To form the sword and spears more ornate sections, I had to manually record multiple vector locations, figure out the distances, then adjust the vectors on the opposite side of the model to match, to keep the model consistent in dimensions. This greatly slowed down the speed of modelling as a result. While there are no doubt other areas I could greatly improve in as well, this was the greatest hindrance and area to improve I would say. On the flipside, by figuring out how to manipulate individual vectors so much made filling in hollows, such as the inside of the letters, or the gaps in the hammer, much easier, as the edges often do not extrude quite as you might expect. Lining up the XYZ of the vertices made fixing this much easier, and my method of ensuring the vertices were symetrical ensured I could do this quickly and easily.

## Animation

Overall, this was MUCH smoother than last time I worked with Unreal. Blender imported the models correctly laid out, and outside of some minor fixes such as reapplying textures, there was little broken with it. My animation this time however was much more ocmplicated, while last year it was relatively simple. I encountered a few problems with the sequencer immediately, and didn't realsie I need to place a camera cut into the sequencer itself to record form it, so even once my animation was done, I ended up wasting more time trying to find out how to get it to record the correct camera and not just the default 0,0,0 position of the scene.

Another issue I encountered was that certain keyframes would inexplicably link together, so I'd change one, and it would then change another, even if deleted and remade from scratch, whichw as immensely frustrating, and is why there is a slight judder to the camera when it climbs up the outside of the tower. The sheer number of objects I had to move also took significant time, and in hindsight, i likely could have apreneted them together to only need to adjust them as sets, instead of all individually. These mistakes cost me time, but thankfully I still managed to complete these two stages well in advance of the deadline.

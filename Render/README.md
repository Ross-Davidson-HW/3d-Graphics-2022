All of the models created in this section were made in Blender, using textures from Textures.com, which can be found in the folder of the same name.

Models made:
- The tower: In fact this is multiple objects to facilitate the animation stage of the project. These are simple cylinders with a stone texture applied for the walls and a wooden texture for the floors. When combined together, they appear rather like a stone tower, or even a Rook from chess. No particular reference was used for this.
- The sword: A slender sword with a golden hilt and ruby gem embedded within it. The reference used is the "MArths Falchion" from Fire Emblem.
- The spear: A short spear with a metal shaft and a golden ornate headpiece, contianing a ruby, that connects the blade and shaft. This was loosely based on the "Wing Spear" from Fire Emblem.
- The warhammer A large, granite block, embedded with a simple design embedded either side, made of gold and lined in steel. The hammer also contains two holes in the head, to breka up the design a bit more. This was loosely based on the "Abyssos War Hammer" from Final Fantasy XIV.
- Logo part one: "THE" is made using another sword model as the "T" and large, cubic letters for the H and E. These are simple models mostly made bye ditting a cube using cuts and then extruding additional faces. No references were used.
- Logo part two: "TOWER" once again making use of the sword model for the "T" while the other four letters are made in the same cubic design and using the same method as the ones used in "THE." No references were used.

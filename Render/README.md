All of the models created in this section were made in Blender, using textures from Textures.com, which can be found in the folder of the same name.

Models made:
The Tower: In fact this is multiple objects to facilitate the animation stage of the project. These are simple cylinders with a stone texture applied for the walls and a wooden texture for the floors. When combined together, they appear rather like a stone tower, or even a Rook from chess. No particular reference was used for this.
- Made using 5 cylinders
- Each cylinder had the top removed, is the same height, and sits the same distance above the previous
- The roof is a flatter cylinder, which then has the crenelations raised using an extruded edge, before the outer edge is then raised higher than the inner to give the sloped effect.
- The floor of each one has a mahogany texture applied, which will be visible during the animation, while the roof is stone around the rim, and granite on the inside.

The Sword: A slender sword with a golden hilt and ruby gem embedded within it. The reference used is the "Marths Falchion" from Fire Emblem.
- Started from a simple cube.
- Extensive use of extruding edges to allow for the hilt to be made.
- Individual vertices moved to ensure that the measurements on both sides are precise and the same.
- Some bevelling used on the handle.
- The majority of the hilt is golden, but using a ruby texture for an embedded gem, as well as some decoration on the actual handle. The blade is steel.

The Spear: A short spear with a metal shaft and a golden ornate headpiece, contianing a ruby, that connects the blade and shaft. This was loosely based on the "Wing Spear" from Fire Emblem.
- Like above, this started as a simple cube.
- Overall used less extruding than the sword, despite an overall more complicated model, as I became more used to Blenders tools.
- The shaft of the spear uses bevelling.
- The spear head itself has a fuller, rather than the overall straight, smooth blade of the sword.
- The spear shaft and head are both made of steel, while the blades crossguard, the counterweight, and the fancy decoration linking the shaft to the spearhead are made of gold. A ruby is also embedded in the decoration.

The Warhammer A large, granite block, embedded with a simple design embedded either side, made of gold and lined in steel. The hammer also contains two holes in the head, to break up the design a bit more. This was loosely based on the "Abyssos War Hammer" from Final Fantasy XIV.
- The reference design was more complicated than expected, so a more general shape along the same lines was used.
- To keep it from being too simple, the hammer head has a design overlaid, and two holes cut in it.
- Creating the holes also left gaps in the mesh model, that had to be fixed. This was done by extruding the edges carefully, then manually lining up the vertices individually to ensure it was seamless.
- The hammer head itself is granite, while the design has a steel edging, with a gold centre. The shaft is also steel, and the counterweight gold.
 
Logo part one: "THE" is made using another sword model as the "T" and large, cubic letters for the H and E.
- The sword model was more complicated than expected, given the other sword was used as a base.
- Adjusting the hilt to be less curve and more T like was expected to take a few minutes, but ended up taking closer to half an hour due to trial and error, and vertices being awkward.
- The letters were simple enough, using cuts and extruded faces to create the shapes, then adjusting the vertices of eadch to be of similar length to allow for consistent sizing.

Logo part two: "TOWER" once again making use of the sword model for the "T" while the other four letters are made in the same cubic design and using the same method as the ones used in "THE."
- Largely the same as the methods used for "THE" though with some refinement on the creation of the letters as I figured out better ways of doing such tasks.

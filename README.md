# 3d-Graphics-2022
A repository for the 3D Graphics and Animation course at Heriot-Watt University, 2022

For this course, we must model, animate and code materials for a TV shows introductory scene. This is split into three main components:

Modeling: creating the actual models used for the sequence, in Blender. These materials are in the Render subdirectory.
Animation: A camera pan over the completed models, in unreal engine, showcasing the key elements.
Interactive: An application that is more interactive, involving the scene created for the show, which will be performed in OpenGL.

There is also the Appendices, for any extra important information, references, etc.

This project centres around a large, castle turret like tower, akin to a Rook from chess. The camera will pan up this structure to the top, before shifting to a top down view. The top of the tower will rotate aside, revealing the room below, which will contain an emblem. This floor will then rotate out, revealing another emblem, then a third, and finally, on the ground floor, the title of the TV show, "The Tower."

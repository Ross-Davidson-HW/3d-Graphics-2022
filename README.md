# 3d-Graphics-2022
A repository for the 3D Graphics and Animation course at Heriot-Watt University, 2022

For this course, we must model, animate and code materials for a TV shows introductory scene. This is split into three main components:

Modeling: creating the actual models used for the sequence, in Blender. These materials are in the Render subdirectory.
Animation: A camera pan over the completed models, in unreal engine, showcasing the key elements.
Interactive: An application that is more interactive, involving the scene created for the show, which will be performed in OpenGL.

There is also the Appendices, for any extra inportant information, references, etc.

This project will focus on a centre pillar, tall and made of stone, with "windows" down its length containing various objects, such as a sword, shield, lance, etc. The camera will pan down the tower slowly, rotating around it, until it coems to the bottom, where the shows title, dubbed "The Tower" will be located. The text for the Tower will use the sword model for the "T" in both words, while the other letters will be more simple 3d models.
